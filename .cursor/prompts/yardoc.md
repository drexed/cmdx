- Avoid unnecessary complexity or duplication
- Consider all possible scenarios for each method or behavior and ensure they are tested.
- Update any pre-existing documentation to match stated rules
- Do NOT include `CMDx` module level docs
- Module level docs description should NOT include `@example`
- Method level docs should include `@example`, `param`, `@options`, `@return`, and any `@raise`
- Hash `@params` should expand with possible `@option`
- Module and method level docs should NOT include `@since`
