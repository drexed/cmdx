# CMDx

> Build business logic that's powerful, predictable, and maintainable.

CMDx is a Ruby framework for building maintainable, observable business logic through composable command/service objects. It brings structure, consistency, and powerful developer tools to your business processes.

## Getting Started

- [Home](https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/index.md): CMDx framework overview, installation, quick examples, and core concepts
- [Getting Started](https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/getting_started/index.md): Task setup and framework fundamentals (CERO pattern)
- [Configuration](https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/configuration/index.md): Comprehensive guide to CMDx configuration

## Basics

- [Setup](https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/basics/setup/index.md): Task structure, inheritance, and basic setup requirements
- [Execution](https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/basics/execution/index.md): Task execution methods (execute vs execute!), error handling, and control flow
- [Context](https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/basics/context/index.md): Context object for data sharing, input/output management, and attribute access
- [Chain](https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/basics/chain/index.md): Execution chain tracking for related tasks within threads

## Interruptions

- [Halt](https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/interruptions/halt/index.md): Intentional task interruption using skip! and fail! methods
- [Faults](https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/interruptions/faults/index.md): Fault exceptions (SkipFault, FailFault) raised by execute! with rich context
- [Exceptions](https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/interruptions/exceptions/index.md): Exception handling differences between execute and execute! methods

## Outcomes

- [Result](https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/outcomes/result/index.md): Result objects exposing execution state, status, context, and metadata
- [States](https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/outcomes/states/index.md): Execution lifecycle states (initialized, executing, complete, interrupted)
- [Statuses](https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/outcomes/statuses/index.md): Business outcome statuses (success, skipped, failed) and transitions

## Attributes

- [Definitions](https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/attributes/definitions/index.md): Attribute declarations (required/optional), validation, and type coercion
- [Naming](https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/attributes/naming/index.md): Customizing accessor method names with prefixes and suffixes
- [Coercions](https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/attributes/coercions/index.md): Automatic type conversion for inputs (string to integer, date parsing, etc.)
- [Validations](https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/attributes/validations/index.md): Input validation rules (presence, length, format, numeric, inclusion, exclusion)
- [Defaults](https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/attributes/defaults/index.md): Default values for optional attributes (static, dynamic, callable)
- [Transformations](https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/attributes/transformations/index.md): Value transformation after coercion but before validation

## Features

- [Callbacks](https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/callbacks/index.md): Execution lifecycle callbacks (before_execution, on_success, on_failure, etc.)
- [Middlewares](https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/middlewares/index.md): Cross-cutting concerns wrapping task execution (authentication, caching, timeouts)
- [Logging](https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/logging/index.md): Structured logging with multiple formatters (JSON, KeyValue, Logstash, Line, Raw)
- [Internationalization](https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/internationalization/index.md): Multi-language support for error messages and validations (90+ locales)
- [Retries](https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/retries/index.md): Automatic retry functionality for transient failures with jitter and selective retries
- [Deprecation](https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/deprecation/index.md): Managing deprecated tasks with logging, warnings, or execution prevention
- [Workflows](https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/workflows/index.md): Composing multiple tasks into sequential pipelines with conditional execution
