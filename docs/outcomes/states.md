# Outcomes - States

States track where a task is in its execution lifecycle—from creation through completion or interruption.

## Definitions

| State | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `initialized` | Task created but execution not yet started. Default state for new tasks. |
| `executing` | Task is actively running its business logic. Transient state during execution. |
| `complete` | Task finished execution successfully without any interruption or halt. |
| `interrupted` | Task execution was stopped due to a fault, exception, or explicit halt. |

State-Status combinations:

| State | Status | Meaning |
| ----- | ------ | ------- |
| `initialized` | `success` | Task created, not yet executed |
| `executing` | `success` | Task currently running |
| `complete` | `success` | Task finished successfully |
| `complete` | `skipped` | Task finished by skipping execution |
| `interrupted` | `failed` | Task stopped due to failure |
| `interrupted` | `skipped` | Task stopped by skip condition |

## Transitions

!!! danger "Caution"

    States are managed automatically—never modify them manually.

```ruby
# Valid state transition flow
initialized → executing → complete    (successful execution)
initialized → executing → interrupted (skipped/failed execution)
```

## Predicates

Use state predicates to check the current execution lifecycle:

```ruby
result = ProcessVideoUpload.execute

# Individual state checks
result.initialized? #=> false (after execution)
result.executing?   #=> false (after execution)
result.complete?    #=> true (successful completion)
result.interrupted? #=> false (no interruption)

# State categorization
result.executed?    #=> true (complete OR interrupted)
```

## Handlers

Handle lifecycle events with state-based handlers. Use `handle_executed` for cleanup that runs regardless of outcome:

```ruby
result = ProcessVideoUpload.execute

# Individual state handlers
result
  .handle_complete { |result| send_upload_notification(result) }
  .handle_interrupted { |result| cleanup_temp_files(result) }
  .handle_executed { |result| log_upload_metrics(result) }
```
