These aren't just implementation details\u2014they're the mental model that makes everything else click. Once you understand how they work together, you'll write cleaner business logic and debug issues faster.</p>\n<p>Let me walk you through each piece, building from a simple task to a fully orchestrated task.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2026-01-09T22:03:27+00:00", "date_published": "2026-01-07T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "drexed"}], "tags": ["Tutorials"]}, {"id": "https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/blog/getting-started-with-cmdx/", "url": "https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/blog/getting-started-with-cmdx/", "title": "Getting Started with CMDx: Taming Business Logic in Ruby", "content_html": "<h1>Getting Started with CMDx: Taming Business Logic in Ruby</h1>\n<p>I've spent years wrestling with service objects.
