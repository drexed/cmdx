I'd have a <code>PlaceOrder</code> service that began as a simple 10-line script but slowly mutated into a 500-line monster handling validation, payments, inventory, shipping, and a dozen notification types. It was a nightmare to test and even harder to read.</p>\n<p>That's exactly why I built CMDx Workflows. They allow you to decompose complex processes into small, focused tasks and orchestrate them declaratively. It turns your business logic from a tangled mess of <code>if</code> statements into a clean, readable pipeline.</p>\n<p>Let's dive into how workflows can transform your Ruby application's architecture.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2026-01-13T18:18:29+00:00", "date_published": "2026-01-28T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "drexed"}], "tags": ["Tutorials"]}, {"id": "https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/blog/mastering-cmdx-outcomes/", "url": "https://drexed.github.io/cmdx/blog/mastering-cmdx-outcomes/", "title": "Mastering CMDx Outcomes: Results, States, and Statuses", "content_html": "<h1>Mastering CMDx Outcomes: Results, States, and Statuses</h1>\n<p>If you've ever found yourself asking \"What does this service object actually return?\", you're not alone.
